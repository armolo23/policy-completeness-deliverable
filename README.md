# Policy Completeness Evaluation Framework

All documentation is now delivered as Jupyter notebooks so every reader can explore the content in a structured, easy-to-digest way.

## Notebook Index

- README.ipynb – executive overview, problem context, and quick start.
- docs/beginners_guide.ipynb – narrative walkthrough for non-technical stakeholders.
- docs/README.ipynb – technical implementation details.
- docs/taxonomy_and_coverage.ipynb – methodology, coverage matrix, and control mapping.

Open the notebooks directly in JupyterLab, VS Code, or any compatible viewer to navigate sections interactively.
